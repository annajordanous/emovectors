This file contains a log of the errors that were fixed (7-10/4/21) in the files:
	jazz/dtl-tjd-import/DTL1000/updates/*.json
	jazz/JECompleteIndex_20210407.csv

I also include some notes of remaining issues, questions, etc.

Question: should "ldr", "arr", "cond", "comp", etc. be mapped to "other"?
 - could they get confused with "other" instruments?
 - no changes made

There seems to be a consistent error where the first name consists of initials
only, that this is omitted in the JSON file. (This results in a name beginning
with a space, which fails to match the surname.) These were inserted manually:
 - Rodriguez should be E.J. Rodriguez (1990s)

	Rodney Green Quartet – Live At Smalls
	SmallsLIVE – SL0036

	Apart from sharing the label (Smalls), they share the same ID number
	(0036), and by unhappy coincidence, the track in DTL1000, Camden (by Rodney
	Green) is on both CDs!   The Birnbaum version is the correct one.
